# Alert: Pod experiencing CrashLoopBackOff Error

## Summary

When a Kubernetes container repeatedly fails to start, it enters a ‘CrashLoopBackOff’ state, indicating a persistent restart loop for that pod. This error often occurs due to various issues preventing the container from launching properly.

By default, a pod’s restart policy is *Always*. Depending on the restart policy defined in the pod template, Kubernetes might try to restart the pod multiple times. When a Pod state is displaying CrashLoopBackOff, it is waiting a certain amount of time before restarting the pod again. 

## Common Causes

### Resource Constraints

One of the common causes of the CrashLoopBackOff error is resource overload or insufficient memory. Kubernetes allows setting memory and CPU usage limits for each pod, which means your application might be crashing due to insufficient resources.

### Application Errors

The application is unable start and instead exits and the Pod is not able to start

### Configuration Errors

Possible configuration errors are,

* Runtime dependencies are missing
* configuration files (via ConfigMaps) or
* incorrect environment variables

These could keep the application from running and therefor the Pod from starting.

### Probes are Misconfigured

The Readiness probe or Liveness Probe failing if the application does not respond within the specified timeframe.

### InitContainer fails to complete

## Troubleshooting

Check logs: Use kubectl logs <name-of-pod> to check the logs of the container. This is often the most direct way to diagnose the issue causing the crashes.
Inspect events: Use kubectl describe pod <name-of-pod> to see events for the Pod, which can provide hints about configuration or resource issues.
Review configuration: Ensure that the Pod configuration, including environment variables and mounted volumes, is correct and that all required external resources are available.
Check resource limits: Make sure that the container has enough CPU and memory allocated. Sometimes, increasing the resources in the Pod definition can resolve the issue.
Debug application: There might exist bugs or misconfigurations in the application code. Running this container image locally or in a development environment can help diagnose application specific issues.

### Testing with a Manu Run

### Restart the Pod
