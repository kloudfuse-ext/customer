= Labeling Customer Tickets

== Priority

A priority is assigned to a ticket to classify its importance to Kloudfuse.  The priority is one of several factors used for determine 
which tickets get worked on.  Other factors include,

* Time/Effort - The amount of work involved in forfilling the request.
* Productivity - The increase in user productivity.
* No. Customers - The number of customers making a similar request.
* Request Scope - Is the request something that should be included in Kloudfuse.
* Support - The amount of effort it would take Kloudfuse to continually support the request.

=== P0 - (Immediate Production Impact)

A P0 ticket is a request for immediate support.  These are the emergencies impacting users of the Kloudfuse Clouster.  These problems, if not immediately addressed, 
could cause major disruptions and requires all hands on deck.

=== P1 - (High Priority)

These tickets are important enough to affect users experience or productivity, but functionality is not completely broken.

=== P2 - (Medium Priority)

P2 requests are improvements or issues that have a moderate impact. They are important for the long-term success but do not need to be jumped on right away. 

=== P3 - (Low Priority)

These are subtle tweaks and enhancements that are more about refinement than necessity. They may help polish your product but donâ€™t dramatically change 
user experience or functionality. 

=== P4 - (Negligible)

These are tasks that are the least urgent and have minimal immediate impact on the project or product. They would be nice to have but are not essential for 
the current functionality or success of the product.

== Type

The type of tickets are used to classify the understanding on what the ticket is for.

=== Task

A request for a discrete amount of work to be requested.  It is not intended to be open ended, but something with a begining and a deliverable.

=== Bug

A defect or error in a computer program that prevents it from functioning as intended.  The keyword here is intended, what a user may expect instead of 
how it was designed.  If the software is designed to deliver X and a customer expects it to be Y, that is not a bug.

=== Question

This is a request for an explaination on how a system or feature works.

=== Feature Request

This is a task relating to change in existing functionality or for new functionality.  If software is designed to deliver X and instead delivers Y, then
it is a bug, not a Feature Request.
